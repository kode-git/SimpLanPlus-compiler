    This example shows the importance of having a fix-point method implemented for performing the effects analysis on functions.
    Without a fix-point method, only y would be marked as deleted, while x would not.
    The correct type in the effect analysis of f is that x |-> d, y |-> d, n |-> rw.
    The program is well-formed and does not output anything, but a and b can both be possibly deleted hence a and b must be reassigned after calling f with them.
